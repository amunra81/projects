QuickCheck 2.8.1 (released 2015-04-03)
	* Fix bug where exceptions thrown printing counterexamples weren't
	  being caught when terminal output was disabled
	* Don't export Test.QuickCheck.Property.result

QuickCheck 2.8 (released 2015-03-18)
	* New features:
		* Support for GHC 7.10
		* Arbitrary instance for Natural
		* New generators shuffle and sublistOf
		* Support for generic coarbitrary
		* When using the cover combinator, insufficient coverage now
		  causes the property to fail

	* API changes:
		* Test.QuickCheck.Function: new pattern synonym Fn
		* genericShrink no longer requires Typeable
		* Result has a new constructor InsufficientCoverage
		* resize throws an error if the size is negative

	* Bug fixes:
		* Fix memory leaks
		* Exceptions thrown by callbacks now cause the test to fail
		* Fixed a bug where the cover combinator wouldn't give a
		  warning if coverage was 0%

QuickCheck 2.7.3 (released 2014-03-24)
	* Add annotations for Safe Haskell.

QuickCheck 2.7.2 (released 2014-03-22)
	* Fix bug in cabal file which broke cabal test

QuickCheck 2.7.1 (released 2014-03-20)
	* Fixed bug - the Small modifier didn't work on unsigned types
	* Changed arbitrarySizedIntegral to have an Integral constraint
	  instead of just Num

QuickCheck 2.7 (released 2014-03-19)

	* New features:
		* New genericShrink function provides generic shrinking with GHC.
		* New combinator x === y: fails if x /= y, but also prints their values
		* New function generate :: Gen a -> IO a for running a generator.
		* New combinators infiniteList and infiniteListOf for generating infinite lists.
		* Several combinators added to the main Test.QuickCheck module which
		  were previously languishing in other modules. Of particular interest:
		  quickCheckAll, ioProperty.
		* New combinators delay and capture which can be used (unsafely!)
		  to reuse the random number seed. Useful for generating
		  polymorphic (rank-2) values.
		* A new Discard data type and a Testable instance for discarding test cases.
		* All modifiers now have Functor instances and accessor functions.
		* Pressing ctrl-C during shrinking now shows the last failed
		  test case, rather than the current shrinking candidate.
		* Experimental support for UHC. You will need the latest version of Cabal from git.

	* Better distribution of test data:
		* The Int generator now only generates fairly small numbers.
		* The new Small and Large modifiers control the distribution of integers
		  (Small generates small numbers, Large from the whole range).
		* Floating-point numbers shrink better.

	* Improved random number generation:
		* QuickCheck now uses TFGen rather than StdGen on newer versions
		  of GHC, because StdGen's random numbers aren't always random.
		* 'variant' now uses a prefix code. This should prevent some
		  potential bananaskins with coarbitrary.

	* API changes:
		* The Gen monad now uses an abstract type QCGen rather than StdGen.
		* The Result type now returns the thrown exception and number
		  of failed shrink attempts.
		* Property is now a newtype rather than Gen Prop as it was before.
		* promote is moved into the new module Test.QuickCheck.Gen.Unsafe.
		* 'printTestCase' is deprecated - its new name is 'counterexample'
		* 'morallyDubiousIOProperty' is deprecated - its new name is
		  'ioProperty', no moral judgement involved :)

QuickCheck 2.6, released 2013-03-07

	* Add convenience Function instances for up to 7-tuples
	* Make stderr line buffered to reduce console I/O.
	* Return a flag to say whether the test case was interrupted.

QuickCheck 2.5, released 2012-06-18

	* Replace maxDiscard with maxDiscardRatio
	* Remove Testable () instance.
	* Added a 'discard' exception that discards the current test case
	* Add accessors for modifiers (where it makes sense)
	* Rename 'stop' to 'abort' to avoid a name clash
	* Added a 'once' combinator
	* If a property is of type Bool, only run it once
	* Add coarbitraryEnum to Test.QuickCheck module.
	* Add 'coarbitrary' helper for Enums.
	* Rejiggled the formatting code to support multi-line error messages
	* Add instances for Ordering and Fixed.
	* Added arbitraryBoundedEnum generator (thanks to Antoine Latter).
	* Add verboseCheckAll and polyverboseCheck function for usability.
